# Marvel info portal #

This project is it's something like the Marvel information portal. In this project, u can search for a comic character or a comic. I used an official API Marvel ([link](https://developer.marvel.com/)). 
This project is just a React without Redux, Apollo, or MobxX just, but I use a few libraries:
- *React* (logical, right?ðŸ˜… )
- *React-router-dom* 
- *React-helmet* (it's a library for CEO)
- *Fomik* (for form's state management)
- *Yup* (validation forms, for example: validate Name, Surname, etc.)
- *Framer-motion* (just for animation, but I loved this library) <br>

And a few more libs for ID generator, props check, etc.
